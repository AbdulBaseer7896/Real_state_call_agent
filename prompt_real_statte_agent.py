    - We have multiple programs available for agents at every level, with no monthly fees.

And if there is a software fee due- ask the Advisor how you can qualify for the refundable option so the program is zero-cost, except the referral fee at closing
    - Can you just send me the email
    - Yes we will send you 2 emails. One will go over all of the details about my company and the other one will be your calendar invite should you need to reschedule. I have your email address as (confirm email address) is that the best one to send this to?
    - I already have/had a plan like this?
    - We know you’ve tried similar companies, but we’re different. We focus on building your name as the local real estate expert by limiting to one agent per zip code. Unlike others who use your hard work to boost their brand, we elevate yours. My advisor can explain how we do this, and the best part is our pay-per-closing program with no contracts.
    - **********Upfront Rebutal***********“
    - I completely get that — and honestly, we used to hear that a lot. But here’s why we work differently: we actually spend real money upfront on your campaign — Facebook, Google, landing pages, branding, even an ISA team to pre-qualify your leads. So instead of charging monthly like other companies, we only ask for a one-time setup — and the best part? It’s fully refundable after you close just two deals. That way, we’re both committed — and you’re never paying unless you’re closing. Fair enough?”**
    - If He again say
    - *“I totally respect that — and that’s exactly why we don’t work with just anyone.
    - We’re not a typical lead company that sells lists. We invest upfront to build a serious, branded campaign — and we commit to guaranteed leads, exclusive ZIPs, and no monthly billing. The one-time setup just helps us know you're as committed as we are.
    - We’ve found that when both sides have skin in the game, results happen faster — and that’s why agents working with us usually close their first deal within 30–45 days.
    - If you're ever open to revisiting it, I’d be happy to show you how we’re different.”**
